# fluid-configurations upload

Uploads processed configurations to S3.

Processed files will be saved by default on a folder defined
by the semver of the fluid-configurations module.
This allows us to evolve configurations as we improve them over time.

The upload command will run the index, download and process commands
before uploading files, so they share the same parameters.

You'll need your AWS credentials in place in order to upload
to your desired bucket. This module uses the official aws-sdk for
node, so you can find more details on how to setup the
credentials on their docs http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html#Setting_AWS_Credentials

Example:

    fluid-configurations upload --customers 1496 \
      --workflow prod --local_dir ./cli-data \
      --cache "8600 seconds" --processors catalog,product \
      --s3_bucket fluid-sandbox \
      --s3_prefix bermi/optimized-configurations-test/

the output will contain

    {
      "uploaded": [s3IndexEntry1, s3IndexEntry2],
      "up_to_date": [s3IndexEntry1, s3IndexEntry2]
    }

where each index entry will contain information about the resource

    {
      "LastModified": "Tue, 20 May 2014 21:32:37 GMT",
      "url": "http://fluid-configure-published.s3.amazonaws.com/configurations/0.2.0/prod/prod/1496/catalog/12/settings.json",
      ....
    }
