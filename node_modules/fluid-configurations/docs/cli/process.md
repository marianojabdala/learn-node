# fluid-configurations process

Processes configurations downloaded from the admin
and generates new configuration files based on processors
defined on the fluid-configurations module under /lib/processors

Processed files will be saved by default on a folder defined
by the semver of the fluid-configurations module.
This allows us to evolve configurations as we improve them over time.

The process command will run the index and download commands before
processing files using the same parameters.

Example:

    fluid-configurations process --customers 1496 \
      --workflow prod --local_dir ./cli-data \
      --cache "5 minutes" --processors catalog,product

will generate

    {
      json: { files: ["path/to/processed/file"]},
      customer: { files: ["path/to/processed/file"]},
      product: { files: ["path/to/processed/file"]},
      catalog: { files: ["path/to/processed/file"]}
    }

If no processor is explicitly set, all the processors will
be executed.

The json and customer processors will always be executed.

Available processors are:

- catalog
- product
- customer
- optimized_report (needs to run in isolation)
- relationships (depends on catalog)

The alias "all" will include all the processors and post processors
defined on config/processors.json.
