Downloads configurations as published by the admin
to s3://fluid-configure-published.s3.amazonaws.com/

The Options documented above or by running the

    fluid-configurations help download

command will define the scope of the files that
will be downloaded.


If no index_file is provided the index will be generated
by running

    fluid-configurations index

first and the file will be cached.

See `fluid-configurations help index` for details.

Example:

    fluid-configurations download --customers 1496 \
      --workflow prod --local_dir ./cli-data

will save the configuration files under ./cli-data/admin-published/
keeping the original configuration modification times, directory
structure and file names.

The command will output a JSON structure with a list of downloaded
and up to date files.

    {
      "downloaded": ["/full/path/to/downloaded_config.js"],
      "up_to_date": ["/full/path/to/up_to_date_config.js"]
    }
