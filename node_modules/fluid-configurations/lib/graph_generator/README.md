Graphs are generated following the steps defined on steps.js

Usage:

    var graphGenerator = require("./index");
    graphGenerator(config); // > outputs an object with multiple graphs
                            // under result.optimizedGraph you can find the main
                            // graph used on configure.
                            // result.graph includes a raw version of the graph
                            // that might include duplicated vertices and edges
                            // result.graph can also include a .issues property
                            // explaining the problems we encountered while
                            // generating the graph.

You should be able to troubleshoot them by running the tests with:

    mocha test/graph_generator.test.js
